      <description>Boring stuff I am South African. I was born and raised in Cape Town and the Klein Karoo. I very quickly became aware that fashion was it for me, so I studied and received a BA of Fashion. I have worked in pretty much every aspect of the fashion industry (designing, manufacturing, styling, retail, customer care, etc) and still find myself wanting to do it all (except pattern-making, please do not ask me about pattern making).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 5 years, I have taken many photographs with several different film cameras. I have a talent for ransacking the charity store electronics section and riffling through friends and familyâ€™s homes for their forgotten camera collections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
